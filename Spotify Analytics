# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Lastly, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the average tempo, duration, and acousticness by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name, 
track_name, 
avg(acousticness), 
avg(duration_ms), 
avg(tempo)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_id

#Then I determined who the top 10 artists are based on danceability.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 10;

#I also was able to determine which artist released the longest song.
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

#Lastly, I was able to determine the average energy of the top 10 songs.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY track_name desc
LIMIT 10;
